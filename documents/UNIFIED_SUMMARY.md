## 🎮 **NEW UNIFIED FEATURES:**

### **🔧 Multiple Operation Modes**
Choose the right mode for your task:

```bash
🟢 ULTIMATE Mode (Default)
   • ALL features enabled
   • Maximum intelligence and capability
   • Best for complex automation

🔥 CONTINUOUS Mode  
   • Step-by-step LLM decisions
   • Real-time adaptation
   • Best for dynamic scenarios

🧠 INTELLIGENT Mode
   • Multi-strategy locators + DOM analysis
   • No continuous LLM (faster)
   • Best for form automation

⚡ BASIC Mode
   • Simple operation
   • Fastest execution
   • Best for simple tasks
```

### **🎯 Smart Element Location**
The unified agent tries multiple strategies in order:
1. **DOM Analyzer** (forms, inputs, structure analysis)
2. **Multi-strategy locate** (7 different approaches)
3. **Smart text locator** (natural language matching)
4. **Accessibility locator** (ARIA attributes)
5. **JavaScript locate** (dynamic element finding)

### **🔄 Dynamic Mode Switching**
Switch modes during runtime:
```
🤖 [ultimate] Your command: mode continuous
✅ Mode changed to: continuous

🤖 [continuous] Your command: go to google.com
🔄 Continuous Mode: Starting for goal 'go to google.com'
```
